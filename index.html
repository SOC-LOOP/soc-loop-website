                    according to all known laws
                    of aviation,
                    <br>
                    there is no way a bee
                    should be able to fly.
                    <br>
                    Its wings are too small to get
                    its fat little body off the ground.
                    <br>
                    The bee, of course, flies anyway
                    <br>

                    because bees don't care
                    what humans think is impossible.
                    <br>

                    Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                    Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                    <br>

                    Ooh, black and yellow!
                    Let's shake it up a little.
                    <br>

                    
                    Barry! Breakfast is ready!

                    Ooming!
                    <br>

                    
                    Hang on a second.
                    <br>

                    
                    Hello?
                    <br>

                    
                    - Barry?
                    - Adam?
                    <br>

                    
                    - Oan you believe this is happening?
                    - I can't. I'll pick you up.
                    <br>

                    
                    Looking sharp.

                    Use the stairs. Your father
                    paid good money for those.
                    <br>

                    
                    Sorry. I'm excited.
                    <br>

                    
                    Here's the graduate.
                    We're very proud of you, son.

                    Ma! I got a thing going here.
                    <br>

                    
                    - You got lint on your fuzz.
                    - Ow! That's me!
                    <br>

                    
                    - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
                    - Bye!
                    <br>

                    
                    Barry, I told you,
                    stop flying in the house!
                    <br>

                    
                    - Hey, Adam.
                    - Hey, Barry.
                    <br>

                    
                    - Is that fuzz gel?
                    - A little. Special day, graduation.
                    <br>

                    
                    Never thought I'd make it.
                    <br>

                    
                    Three days grade school,
                    three days high school.
                    <br>

                    
                    Those were awkward.
                    <br>

                    
                    Three days college. I'm glad I took
                    a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
                    <br>

                    
                    You did come back different.
                    <br>

                    
                    - Hi, Barry.
                    - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
                    <br>

                    
                    - Hear about Frankie?
                    - Yeah.
                    <br>

                    
                    - You going to the funeral?
                    - No, I'm not going.
                    <br>

                    
                    Everybody knows,
                    sting someone, you die.
                    <br>

                    
                    Don't waste it on a squirrel.
                    Such a hothead.
                    <br>

                    
                    I guess he could have
                    just gotten out of the way.
                    <br>

                    
                    I love this incorporating
                    an amusement park into our day.
                    <br>

                    
                    That's why we don't need vacations.
                    <br>

                    
                    Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
                    under the circumstances.
                    <br>

                    
                    - Well, Adam, today we are men.
                    - We are!
                    <br>

                    
                    - Bee-men.
                    - Amen!
                    <br>

                    - What does that do?
                    - Oatches that little strand of honey
                    <br>

                    
                    that hangs after you pour it.
                    Saves us millions.

                    Can anyone work on the Krelman?
                    <br>

                    
                    Of course. Most bee jobs are
                    small ones. But bees know
                    <br>

                    
                    that every small job,
                    if it's done well, means a lot.
                    <br>

                    
                    But choose carefully
                    <br>

                    
                    because you'll stay in the job
                    you pick for the rest of your life.
                    <br>

                    
                    The same job the rest of your life?
                    I didn't know that.
                    <br>

                    
                    What's the difference?
                    <br>

                    
                    You'll be happy to know that bees,
                    as a species, haven't had one day off
                    <br>

                    
                    in 27 million years.
                    <br>

                    
                    So you'll just work us to death?
                    <br>

                    
                    We'll sure try.
                    <br>

                    
                    Wow! That blew my mind!
                    <br>

                    
                    "What's the difference?"
                    How can you say that?
                    <br>

                    
                    One job forever?
                    That's an insane choice to have to make.
                    <br>

                    
                    I'm relieved. Now we only have
                    to make one decision in life.
                    <br>

                    
                    But, Adam, how could they
                    never have told us that?
                    <br>

                    
                    Why would you question anything?
                    We're bees.
                    <br>

                    
                    We're the most perfectly
                    functioning society on Earth.
                    <br>

                    
                    You ever think maybe things
                    work a little too well here?
                    <br>

                    
                    Like what? Give me one example.
                    <br>

                    
                    I don't know. But you know
                    what I'm talking about.
                    <br>

                    
                    Please clear the gate.
                    Royal Nectar Force on approach.
                    <br>

                    
                    Wait a second. Oheck it out.
                    <br>

                    - Wow.
